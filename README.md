## Testing

The site has been tested on Firefox and Chrome. On each web browser it was checked to see the overall responsiveness of the site from several screen widths (1200px, 950px & 360px). During this stage, it was noticed that some of the text in some sections i.e Times, would overlap and did not appear very clear.

All navigation buttons, and main logo have all been checked to ensure the user is taken to the correct page via the links.

Join In form has been checked to ensure all data that is required has been entered correctly, if missing or incorrect the user will not be able to submit. Also an error message will appear informing the user of this.
